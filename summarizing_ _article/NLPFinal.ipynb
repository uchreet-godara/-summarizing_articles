       "2  [england coach andy robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the six nations defeat by wales., robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the 11-9 loss as he contemplates sunday's set-to with france at twickenham, lewis moody and martin corry could both return after missing the game with hamstring and shoulder problems, and the midfield pairing of mathew tait and jamie noon is also under threat, olly barkley immediately allowed england to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant tait just before the hour, the bath fly-half-cum-centre is likely to start against france, with either tait or noon dropping out., tait, given little opportunity to shine in attack, received praise from robinson afterwards, even if the coach admitted cardiff was an \"unforgiving place\" for the teenage prodigy, robinson now has a tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line, after just one outing, a player he regards as central to england's future, tait himself, at least outwardly, appeared unaffected by the punishing treatment dished out to him by gavin henson in particular, \"i want more of that definitely,\" he said, \"hopefully i can train hard this week and get selected for next week but we'll have to look at the video and wait and see, \"we were playing on our own 22 for a lot of the first half so it was quite difficult, i thought we defended reasonably well but we've just got to pick it up for france.\", his newcastle team-mate noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major test, he missed a tackle on michael owen in the build-up to wales' try, conceded a penalty at the breakdown, was turned over in another tackle and fumbled gavin henson's cross-kick into touch, all inside the first quarter, his contribution improved in the second half, but england clearly need more of a playmaker in the inside centre role, up front, the line-out remains fallible, despite a superb performance from chris jones, whose athleticism came to the fore after stepping into the side for moody, it is more likely the leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the french forwards, with andy hazell likely to make way, lock ben kay also justified his recall with an impressive all-round display on his return to the side, but elsewhere england positives were thin on the ground.]   \n",

       "2  England coach Andy Robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the Six Nations defeat by Wales.The Bath fly-half-cum-centre is likely to start against France, with either Tait or Noon dropping out.Robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the 11-9 loss as he contemplates Sunday's set-to with France at Twickenham.It is more likely the Leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the French forwards, with Andy Hazell likely to make way.And the midfield pairing of Mathew Tait and Jamie Noon is also under threat.Tait, given little opportunity to shine in attack, received praise from Robinson afterwards, even if the coach admitted Cardiff was an \"unforgiving place\" for the teenage prodigy.His Newcastle team-mate Noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major Test.Olly Barkley immediately allowed England to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant Tait just before the hour.   \n",

       "2222  [faster, better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets, research suggests., instead, phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake, consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size, onboard memory or the chip inside, shows an in-depth study by telecommunications company ericsson, \"historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology,\" said dr michael bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab, \"we have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives,\" he said, \"we should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing,\" he told the bbc news website., for the study, ericsson interviewed 14,000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone, \"people's habits remain the same,\" said dr bjorn, \"they just move the activity into the mobile phone as it's a much more convenient way to do it.\", one good example of this was diary-writing among younger people, he said, while diaries have always been popular, a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form, youngsters' use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way, dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it, the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles, ericsson's research has shown that consumers divide into different \"tribes\" that use phones in different ways, dr bjorn said groups dubbed \"pioneers\" and \"materialists\" were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use, \"for instance,\" he said, \"older people are using sms much more than they did five years ago.\" this was because younger users, often the children of ageing mobile owners, encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch., another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists, only when about 25% of people have handsets with new innovations on them, such as cameras, can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it., once this significant number of users is passed, use of new innovations tends to take off, dr bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop, however, he said, now 45% of the japanese people ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month, in 2003 the figure was 29%, similarly, across europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise, in 2003 only 4% of the people in the uk took a phonecam snap at least once a month, now the figure is 14%, similar rises have been seen in many other european nations, dr bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras, \"usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras,\" he said, digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings, holidays and birthdays, by contrast, he said, camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life., lifestyle 'governs mobile choice']   \n",

       "2222  Dr Bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras.However, he said, now 45% of the Japanese people Ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month.Dr Bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in Japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop.Dr Bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it, the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles.For the study, Ericsson interviewed 14,000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone.Dr Bjorn said groups dubbed \"pioneers\" and \"materialists\" were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use.By contrast, he said, camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life.While diaries have always been popular, a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form.\"Historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology,\" said Dr Michael Bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at Ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab.Another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists.One good example of this was diary-writing among younger people, he said.\"They just move the activity into the mobile phone as it's a much more convenient way to do it.\"\"People's habits remain the same,\" said Dr Bjorn.   \n",
       "2223  The Cell processor, which will drive Sony's PlayStation 3, will run 10-times faster than current PC chips, its designers have said.IBM has said it will sell a workstation with the chip starting later this year.The chip will run at speeds of greater than 4 GHz, the firms said.While the PlayStation 3 is likely to be the first mass-market product to use Cell, the chip's designers have said the flexible architecture means that it would be useful for a wide range of applications, from servers to mobile phones.If Cell is to challenge Intel's range of chips in the marketplace, it will need to find itself inside PCs, which predominantly run using Windows.Sony, IBM and Toshiba, who have been working on the Cell processor for three years, unveiled the chip on Monday.It is being designed for use in graphics workstations, the new PlayStation console, and has been described as a supercomputer on a chip.By comparison, rival chip maker Intel's fastest processor runs at 3.8 GHz.IBM said Cell was \"OS neutral\" and would support multiple operating systems simultaneously but designers would not confirm if Microsoft's Windows was among those tested with the chip.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
